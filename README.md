# 📧 Spam Message Classifier - CODTECH Internship Task 4

This project is part of my CODTECH internship and involves building a **Spam Classifier** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning in Python.

---

## 🚀 Objective

To build a predictive model using **scikit-learn** that can classify text messages as **"spam"** or **"ham" (not spam)**.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- CountVectorizer
- Naive Bayes Classifier

---

## 📁 Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `spam_classifier.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook with code and output |
| `task.py` | Python script for spam classification |
| `spam.csv` | Dataset of spam and ham messages |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

---

## 📊 Dataset Info

The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as **ham (not spam)** or **spam**.

Example rows:
label,message
ham,Hi there how are you?
spam,Congratulations! You've won a free ticket...

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Text Vectorization**: `CountVectorizer`
- **Classifier**: `Multinomial Naive Bayes`
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score

---

## 📈 Sample Output

Accuracy: 0.90
Precision: 0.89
Recall: 0.91

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-classifier
cd spam-classifier

2. Open `spam_classifier.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

3. Make sure `spam.csv` is in the same directory.

4. Run all cells to train and test the model.
